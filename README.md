    Don't be average, Aim to either be the best, or to be the worst.

## Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
If you are reading this, I am **Maple**!

## Things I do here, is just for fun!

Just want to show off the cool little things I build from time to time.
Don't expect, large scaled stuff here, just the small little things I like doing time to time.
